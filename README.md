This repository demonstrates a race condition in PHP when incrementing a shared counter from multiple processes. The `bug.php` file shows the problem, while `bugSolution.php` presents a solution using a mutex lock to synchronize access to the shared resource.  The race condition can lead to lost increments and inaccurate counting. The solution ensures that only one process can modify the counter at a time, preserving data integrity.
